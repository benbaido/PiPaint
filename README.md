# PiPaint
Pi project for Pi class

The user will be able to touch pad and draw on the LED display. They will be able to choose the size of the pen or brush and erase the display by pressing buttons. Since it’s a resistive touch pad the user will be able to use either their finger or a stylus to draw.

The materials I’m going to use are:
- Raspberry Pi
- Resistive touch screen overlay
- 16x32 LED Matrix
- Resistive Touch Screen to USB Mouse Controller - AR1100
- A few buttons
- A couple of resistors
- Some wires
